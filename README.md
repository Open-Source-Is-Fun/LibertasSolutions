## Post Install Script
The post (k)ubuntu installation script installs the default application and "nice to haves" that comes with our linux os installation service.

The script can be run with the command:
```shell
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Open-Source-Is-Fun/LibertasSolutions/refs/heads/main/postInstallation.sh | bash
```
The script logs can be found here: `/var/log/postinstall.log`
